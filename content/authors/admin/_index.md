<div style="text-align: justify">

I'm a final-year biological sciences studying in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) and a massive data enthusiast. Throughout the years, I have self-learnt [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and I aspire to work as a data analyst in the future. 

I am passionate about building automated data analysis mediums such as [Tableau Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/justin.chia#!/vizhome/capstone_videogamesales/SalesDash), [Rmarkdown reports](https://rpubs.com/justjooz/miss_data), [R Shiny Web Apps](https://justjooz.shinyapps.io/titanR/) and [Python Tkinter GUIs](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm). These apps have helped employers and myself alike, drastically reduce human error and turnaround time. Beyond my programming and data visualisation skills, I firmly believe in constantly learning new technologies and digital skills to stay relevant.

In my free time, I enjoy building up my own digital projects such as writing a personal poetry blog, creating digital content on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yonah.creative/), managing my own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKKD9__L5ukboJLX-iUx_Q), and authoring my own [bird watching blog](https://www.birdingoutdoors.com).
