I'm a final-year biological sciences studying in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) and a massive data enthusiast. Having self-learnt [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). I am passionate about building automated data analysis platforms such as R Shiny Web Apps and Python Tkinter GUIs. These apps have helped several employers drastically reduce human error and turnaround time. Despite my knowledge in programming and data visualisationt, I am always motivated to upskill myself with new technologies and digital skills to stay relevant.

In my free time, I enjoy building up my own projects in building my own websites, GUI apps, web apps, and scripts, which all work to reduce repetitive analysis work. I also write my personal poetry blog, create digital content on (instagram)[https://www.instagram.com/yonah.creative/], manage my own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzKKD9__L5ukboJLX-iUx_Q), and write my own [bird watching blog](https://www.birdingoutdoors.com).
